Ik hacks are filled with ai fluff, but this one is different
It has taste, something which ai can't replicate but humans need to hit
their brain or rather must have power to think gd designs - ig this has it

### run it
git clone, then:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

cosmos isn't just a "space app". it's a whole vibe. drag planets, build solar systems, learn stuff, and actually enjoy looking at the screen. no generic slop allowed here.

### whats in it
- **3d planets** - view any planet in 3d, rotate it around, looks sick
- **solar system builder** - drag n drop game where u place planets in their orbits
- **space quiz** - test ur knowledge, different difficulties
- **flashcards** - study mode for space facts
- **celestial calendar** - track moon phases, eclipses, meteor showers n stuff
- **ai chat** - ask questions bout space, get actual answers not bs
